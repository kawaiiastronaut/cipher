# cipher
A switch and a vigenere cipher
This cipher first switches letters with a predetermined letter. 
Then converts the letters into their corresponding numbers.
After this, the cipher uses the word "hello" on a loop to add to these numbers.
h=8 e=5 l=12 l=12 o=15
This program also contains a deciper function to undo messages that were written in this way.
